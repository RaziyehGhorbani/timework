            <h2>what is physical self-care</h2>
            <p>Physical Self-Care is the most basic and important form of self-care that you can practice. It can be as simple as brushing your teeth in the morning or taking a warm shower. Once you’re able to practice good physical self-care, you’ll then be able to adopt other forms of self-care into your routine as well.</p>

            <h2>Get Enough Rest</h2>
            <p>Prioritizing your sleep is part of your self-care. As an adult, try to get between 7-9 hours of sleep each night. It’s also important to get enough rest during the day. This might mean taking several short breaks each day, so that you can return to your work with more energy and a clearer mind.</p>

            <h2>Eat Well and Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <p>Eating healthy is all about balance. Food that makes you feel nourished and taken care of is important, but so is treating yourself from time to time. Along with full, balanced meals, it’s good to drink a lot of water throughout the day. Taking care of these basic needs may seem obvious, but they are incredibly important. We can all make these small decisions throughout the day on what we put into our bodies to make us feel good.</p>

            <h2>Move Your Body</h2>
            <p>Physical activity is healthy for our bodies and our minds. It’s a form of self-care that can boost your mood and clear your head. Even a short 15-30 minute walk around your neighborhood is a great way to take care of your body daily. You can also try out new kinds of exercises, like yoga or hiking. We know that right now we can’t really do walks or any activities outside because we still need the smoke to clear. In the meantime, stay safe and indoors.</p>
