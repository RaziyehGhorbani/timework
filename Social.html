            <h2>what is social self care?</h2> 
            <p>The act of taking care of one's own wellbeing through maintaining positive social relationships and by establishing meaningful connections and developing one's social identity.</p>

            <h2>friends</h2>
            <p id="friends">While people often assume that self care is something you do independently of others, many do not realize that some of the best forms of self care can be done with a best friend! <br> 

                As humans, we’re social beings (even if we’re introverts), which means doing things with a friend or two is significantly more fun. <br>
                
                Even more, incorporating a friend into your self care routine can make it easier to maintain a self care regimen. <br> Self care should come naturally, but let's be real: Incorporating self care can be taxing when there are so many other stressors and responsibilities to manage.  <br>As our to-do lists stack up, we fall further and further down the list. By inviting a friend to join you in practicing self care, you’ll be more likely to actually stick to your plan, as you'll have someone to hold you accountable when you put something else ahead of you. <br>A study finds talking to friends even for short periods can help your mental health. <br>Discussing mental health has increasingly become normalized say experts, which can help people prioritize their well-being.</p>
                <h2>social media</h2>
                <p id="media">Social media has become a significant part of our daily lives, as we check apps like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok on a daily basis. <br>  While there are many positive aspects of social media, there are drawbacks to these platforms as well. <br> Social media can affect our mental health; when we compare ourselves to others and see how much happier other people appear to be, it can make us feel depressed or anxious, among other feelings. <br>That’s where self-care comes in to combat the negative effects of social media. <br>If the content on your news feeds is  negatively impacting your mental health,</p>
                <h2>Boundaries</h2>
                <p id="boundaries">Boundaries help you establish clear limits and expectations for yourself and others. <br> When you set #boundaries, you are communicating your #needs and priorities to others, and you are establishing guidelines for what is acceptable and what is not.Boundaries in care work help maintain the necessary distance between the person giving and the person receiving care. <br> These boundaries help ensure all needs are met. Examples of boundaries in health and social care include: Focused relationships.</p>
