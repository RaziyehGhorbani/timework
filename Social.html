           <h2 id="self"><em>What Is Social Self Care?</em></h2> 
            <p>The act of taking care of one's own wellbeing through maintaining positive social relationships and by establishing meaningful connections and developing one's social identity.</p>
            
                <br><br>
                <h2><em>1.Social Media</em></h2>
                <p id="media">Social media has become a significant part of our daily lives, as we check apps like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok on a daily basis. <br>  While there are many positive aspects of social media, there are drawbacks to these platforms as well. <br> Social media can affect our mental health; when we compare ourselves to others and see how much happier other people appear to be, it can make us feel depressed or anxious, among other feelings. <br>That’s where self-care comes in to combat the negative effects of social media. <br>If the content on your news feeds is  negatively impacting your mental health,</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2><em>2.Boundaries</em></h2>
                <p id="boundaries">Boundaries help you establish clear limits and expectations for yourself and others. <br> When you set #boundaries, you are communicating your #needs and priorities to others, and you are establishing guidelines for what is acceptable and what is not.Boundaries in care work help maintain the necessary distance between the person giving and the person receiving care. <br> These boundaries help ensure all needs are met. Examples of boundaries in health and social care include: Focused relationships.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2><em>3.Friends</em></h2>
            <p id="friends">While people often assume that self care is something you do independently of others, many do not realize that some of the best forms of self care can be done with a best friend! <br> 

                As humans, we’re social beings (even if we’re introverts), which means doing things with a friend or two is significantly more fun. <br>
                
                Even more, incorporating a friend into your self care routine can make it easier to maintain a self care regimen. <br> Self care should come naturally, but let's be real: Incorporating self care can be taxing when there are so many other stressors and responsibilities to manage.  <br>As our to-do lists stack up, we fall further and further down the list. By inviting a friend to join you in practicing self care, you’ll be more likely to actually stick to your plan, as you'll have someone to hold you accountable when you put something else ahead of you. <br>A study finds talking to friends even for short periods can help your mental health. <br>Discussing mental health has increasingly become normalized say experts, which can help people prioritize their well-being.</p> <br>

                        <tbody><tr><td rowspan="8">idea <br> for you <br> and your <br> best friend</td></tr>
                       <tr> <td>Get your nails done</td> <td><small>This is the classic girls get together, so of course it’s at the top of our list. It’s a really small activity that can instantly lift your spirits and your physical well-being. Pro-tip: find a salon that gives you champagne or coffee while you get your nails done.</small></td><!-- 1 --></tr>
                    <tr><td>Make Saturday or Sunday morning brunch together</td><td><small>Reality is that if you go out to your normal brunch spot, you’re going to spend a ton of money. Breakfast and brunch is one of the easiest meals to make and perfect, and there’s so much variety. Choose all your favorite dishes and make a feast. And best of all, eat it.</small></td><!-- 2 --></tr>
                    <tr><td>Binge an entire tv show.</td><td><small>There’s SO MUCH good television, and sometimes what you need is a full day on the couch. May we recommend a few of our favorite shows with women as leads? Jane the Virgin, Grace and Frankie, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Handmaid’s Tale, Insecure, Black-ish, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Now go on and binge. Hopefully with snacks.</small></td></tr><!-- 3 -->
                    <tr><td>Learn to make a new cocktail</td><td><small>Like going out for brunch, getting cocktails can quickly become a very expensive night out. Instead, choose one of your favorites or something entirely new, shake it out, and pour it in the fancy glasses you never use. You’ll feel ultra glam.</small></td></tr><!-- 4 -->
                    <tr><td>Explore new a neighborhood by foot or bike.</td><td><small> Fred and Far is based in Los Angeles, so there are tons of neighborhoods we’ve never been to but are so cute and walkable! Make it a date to explore a new place rather than eating at the same dim sum place you go every week. You might find something new you love!</small></td></tr><!-- 5 -->
                    <tr><td>Make a list of things you love about each other</td><td><small>Matter of fact is that we don’t celebrate one another enough. Make time in your day to just write down all the things that make your friend beautiful, special, and just absolutely perfect. Sometimes we need to hear and be reminded of how great we are.</small></td></tr><!-- 6 -->
                    <tr><td> Make a homemade facial mask</td><td><small> Here’s another idea on the cheap. You can use household items that you have already to refresh your face and body. Plus, it’s super fun to look like green monsters together.</small></td></tr><!-- 7 -->
