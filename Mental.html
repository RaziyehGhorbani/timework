        <h2 id="heading1"><em>What is Mental Health?</em></h2>
        <p>
          Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to
          cope with the stresses of life,realize their abilities, learn well and
          work well, and contribute to their community.It is an integral
          component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and
          collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape
          the world we live in.Mental health is a basic human right.And it is
          crucial to personal , community and socio-economic development.
          <br /><br />
          Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders.It exists
          on a complex continuum,which is experienced differently from one
          person to the next,with varying degrees of difficulty and distress
          and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes.
          <br /><br />
          Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial
          disabilities as well as other mental states associated with
          significant distress,impairment in functioning , or risk of self-harm.
          people with mental health conditions are more likely to experience
          lower levels of mental well being, but this is not always or
          necessarily the case.

        <h2 id="heading2"><em>1.Loving Your True Self</em></h2>
        <p>
          How-to-love-yourself advice is ubiquitous these days. Step into your
          favorite local gift shop and you’ll likely find self-love manifesting
          candles topped with rose quartz, positive-affirmation card decks, and
          pillows embossed with Brene Brown self-compassion quotes. Scroll
          through Instagram or TikTok and you’ll probably encounter influencer
          types spouting self-love advice that often ignores the many complex
          reasons why someone might struggle with self-worth—a barrage of “you
          just have to love yourself” toxic positivity
          <br /><br />
          while it may seem cheesy or oversimplified, most mental health
          professionals will tell you, in one way or another, that being kinder
          to and more accepting of yourself is important for both mental
          well-being and healthy relationships. However, a variety of factors
          (trauma, years of self-criticism, and systemic discrimination to name
          a few) can make this simple-sounding practice way more complicated—and
          much easier said than done.
        </p>
        <h2 id="heading3"><em>2.Having Hobbies</em></h2>
        <p>
          This time of year is often associated with transformations, so now can
          be the perfect time to pick up a new hobby or skill. A hobby is an
          activity that is done during leisure time that you look forward to and
          enjoy. Having a hobby is beneficial to living a happier and healthier
          life because it helps you take your mind off of other things by doing
          something that brings you joy. A hobby can be almost anything, such as
          reading a book, hiking, baking, and collecting seashells and the best
          way to pursue a hobby is to try something new. There are many fun and
          exciting options to get involved in, but each of us are unique. Once
          we find something that we are really passionate about, it can delight
          and fulfill our lives with positivity.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Hobbies</strong> can reduces stress and improves well being .
          Research has shown that engaging in enjoyable activities during your
          free time can lower your blood pressure, cortisol (your body’s main
          stress hormone) levels, and depression. <br />
          Improves relationships. When you pick up a hobby, often, you may see
          or hear about others that have the same interest as you. <br />
          Teaches patience. When you start a new hobby, you first have to learn
          how to do it, which can take time and perseverance. When you stay
          persistent and patient, you will be rewarded for accomplishing a goal
          that you set. <br />
          Helps alleviate boredom. Hobbies give you something to do and
          something to look forward to and get excited about. <br />
          Develop new skills. The more and more you do something, the better and
          better you will get. <br />

        <h2 id="heading4"><em>3.Stress Management</em></h2>
        <p>
          While it may seem like there’s nothing you can do about stress at work
          and home, there are steps you can take to distress and regain control.
          <br />
          It may seem like there’s nothing you can do about stress. The bills
          won’t stop coming, there will never be more hours in the day, and your
          work and family responsibilities will always be demanding. But you
          have a lot more control than you might think. <br />
          If you’re living with high levels of stress, you’re putting your
          entire well-being at risk. Stress wreaks havoc on your emotional
          equilibrium, as well as your overall physical and mental health. It
          narrows your ability to think clearly, function effectively, and enjoy
          life. <br /> 
          Effective stress management helps you break the hold stress has
          on your life, so you can be happier, healthier, and more productive.
          The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work,
          relationships, relaxation, and fun—and the resilience to hold up under
          pressure and meet challenges head on. But stress management is not
          one-size-fits-all. That’s why it’s important to experiment and find
          out what works best for you.
