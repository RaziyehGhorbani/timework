    <p>Self-care is an important part of maintaining mental and physical health. It is the practice of taking care of one's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. For students, self-care is essential to maintaining a balance between school and wellness. Self-care can involve anything from getting enough sleep to practicing meditation or taking a break from studies to spend time with friends.

        It is also important to remember that self-care looks different for everyone. What works for one person may not work for another. Some people may find it helpful to spend time outdoors, while others may prefer to practice yoga or journaling. Finding the self-care activities that work best for you is a crucial part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>

    <h2><em>1-Time management</em></h2>
    <p id="media">Self Care Management is the care and encouragement provided to people with long term health conditions and their families to help them understand their role in managing their condition better on a day to day basis.  It helps people to make more informed decisions about their care, engage in healthy behaviours and to access further support.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2><em>2-learning</em></h2>
    <p id="learning">The act of learning something new can help reduce stress and anxiety, help keep your brain healthy, and provide avenues for social connections based around something you are passionate about.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2><em>3-having breaks</em></h2>
    <p id="having breaks">Learning how to take a break while still having self-control helps us take care of our mental health and well-being. It shows us that we can work hard and value rest simultaneously. It's a form of self-care because we choose to improve our physical and mental health rather than let our work harm it.</p>
