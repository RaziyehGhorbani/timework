        <h2>What Is Self-Care?</h2>
        <p>
          Self-care is activity that supports a person’s emotional, mental and
          physical health. An individual’s self-care activities are essentially
          a personalized wellness program. One person may find a forest hike
          just the solution to reinvigorate their body and spirit. Others may
          choose to knit, read or go out with friends when they need to
          replenish the well. These are some common examples of self-care. But
          self-care doesn’t only mean partaking in a fun pastime. Other types of
          self-care may involve taking care of one’s financial matters, such as
          setting and adhering to a budget or starting a retirement fund.
          Self-care may entail improving one’s physical health through exercise,
          or setting goals for one’s career, education or personal life. It can
          also mean seeing a doctor or therapist, because self-care can include
          seeking professional help. For social workers, the first indication
          that they may need to focus on some type of self-care is if they begin
          to experience burnout. Burnout is described as a feeling of
          exhaustion, lack of motivation and a sense of ineffectiveness at work.
          Individuals in any profession can experience burnout, causing them to
          become irritable, depressed or angry. Compassion fatigue, when a
          social worker loses empathy for their clients, is often a result of
          burnout.

        <h2>What Are the Benefits of Self-Care?</h2>

        <p>
          When social workers sense they have become less effective at their job
          due to burnout, they may turn to self-care activities. However, the
          most powerful self-care happens before burnout sets in. Social workers
          with a mindset for supporting their own wellness can reap the benefits
          of self-care. These can include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Reduced stress. Activities that help with stress management include
            a brisk walk after work or turning off email notifications in the
            evenings and on days off.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased well-being. Self-care can have a cascade effect, meaning
            an improvement in one aspect of a person’s well-being, such as their
            mental health, can contribute to improved well-being in other
            aspects, including their physical and emotional health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sense of accomplishment. Setting goals and achieving them can boost
            a person’s confidence
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved health. Self-care activities can help a person manage their
            physical and emotional health, which can lead to better long-term
            disease management. They can also help prevent illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Healthy relationships. Burnout can cause anger, depression and other
            negative emotions to seep into an individual’s personal and
            professional relationships. Conversely, self-care can help
            strengthen a person’s relationships with their family and colleagues
          </li>
          <li>
            Professional satisfaction. When a person takes care of themselves
            physically and emotionally, they are better able to be effective at
            their job.
