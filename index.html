        <h2>What Is Self-Care?</h2>
        <p>
          Self-care is activity that supports a person’s emotional, mental and
          physical health. An individual’s self-care activities are essentially
          a personalized wellness program. One person may find a forest hike
          just the solution to reinvigorate their body and spirit. Others may
          choose to knit, read or go out with friends when they need to
          replenish the well. These are some common examples of self-care. But
          self-care doesn’t only mean partaking in a fun pastime. Other types of
          self-care may involve taking care of one’s financial matters, such as
          setting and adhering to a budget or starting a retirement fund.
          Self-care may entail improving one’s physical health through exercise,
          or setting goals for one’s career, education or personal life. It can
          also mean seeing a doctor or therapist, because self-care can include
          seeking professional help. For social workers, the first indication
          that they may need to focus on some type of self-care is if they begin
          to experience burnout. Burnout is described as a feeling of
          exhaustion, lack of motivation and a sense of ineffectiveness at work.
          Individuals in any profession can experience burnout, causing them to
          become irritable, depressed or angry. Compassion fatigue, when a
          social worker loses empathy for their clients, is often a result of
          burnout.
