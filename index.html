        <h2><em>What Is Self-Care?</em></h2>
        <p>
          Self-care is activity that supports a person’s emotional, mental and
          physical health. An individual’s self-care activities are essentially
          a personalized wellness program. One person may find a forest hike
          just the solution to reinvigorate their body and spirit. Others may
          choose to knit, read or go out with friends when they need to
          replenish the well. These are some common examples of self-care. But
          self-care doesn’t only mean partaking in a fun pastime. Other types of
          self-care may involve taking care of one’s financial matters, such as
          setting and adhering to a budget or starting a retirement fund.
          Self-care may entail improving one’s physical health through exercise,
          or setting goals for one’s career, education or personal life. It can
          also mean seeing a doctor or therapist, because self-care can include
          seeking professional help. For social workers, the first indication
          that they may need to focus on some type of self-care is if they begin
          to experience burnout. Burnout is described as a feeling of
          exhaustion, lack of motivation and a sense of ineffectiveness at work.
          Individuals in any profession can experience burnout, causing them to
          become irritable, depressed or angry. Compassion fatigue, when a
          social worker loses empathy for their clients, is often a result of
          burnout.

        <h2><em>What Are the Benefits of Self-Care?</em></h2>

        <p>
          When social workers sense they have become less effective at their job
          due to burnout, they may turn to self-care activities. However, the
          most powerful self-care happens before burnout sets in. Social workers
          with a mindset for supporting their own wellness can reap the benefits
          of self-care. These can include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Reduced stress. Activities that help with stress management include
            a brisk walk after work or turning off email notifications in the
            evenings and on days off.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased well-being. Self-care can have a cascade effect, meaning
            an improvement in one aspect of a person’s well-being, such as their
            mental health, can contribute to improved well-being in other
            aspects, including their physical and emotional health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sense of accomplishment. Setting goals and achieving them can boost
            a person’s confidence
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved health. Self-care activities can help a person manage their
            physical and emotional health, which can lead to better long-term
            disease management. They can also help prevent illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Healthy relationships. Burnout can cause anger, depression and other
            negative emotions to seep into an individual’s personal and
            professional relationships. Conversely, self-care can help
            strengthen a person’s relationships with their family and colleagues
          </li>
          <li>
            Professional satisfaction. When a person takes care of themselves
            physically and emotionally, they are better able to be effective at
            their job.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>What Are Types of Self-Care?</em></h2>
        <p>
          Many people allow themselves an indulgence after a stressful day of
          work. One of the problems with this behavior is that it’s often
          confused with self-care. When the behavior is taken to an extreme,
          however, it can cause more problems than it’s meant to solve. For
          instance, overindulging in alcohol or food, or running up credit card
          debt, can lead to physical health issues and financial difficulties.
          These behaviors worsen stress — they don’t alleviate it. The most
          effective self-care for social workers is to engage in healthy,
          productive behaviors that support their physical, mental and emotional
          well-being. Practicing self-care in this way allows them to be
          confident and effective in their work, and ensures they support their
          own goals for how to live their lives. The following are the most
          common types of self-care.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3><em>1. Mental Self-Care</em></h3>
        <p>
          Mental stimulation, such as learning new things, can help with a
          person’s energy and outlook. Activities may include reading or
          listening to a new book or podcast, doing brain teasers or trying out
          a new hobby. It can be as simple as learning a new route to and from
          work. Anything that gets a person out of a mental rut can be mental
          self-care.
        </p>

        <h3><em>2. Physical Self-Care</em></h3>
        <p>
          The expression “a sound mind in a sound body” may be old-fashioned,
          but it’s a core principle of physical self-care. Examples of physical
          self-care include adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly and
          getting plenty of sleep. Physical self-care will be different for
          everyone. It’s most effective when an individual identifies their
          goals and the steps they want to take to achieve them.
        </p>

        <h3><em>3. Social Self-Care</em></h3>
        <p>
          According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
          loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher rates of
          depression, suicide and death. For many people, relationships with
          friends and family can be a nourishing source of mental and emotional
          well-being. However, relationships can also be a source of stress and
          unhappiness. Social self-care is complicated; activities that may work
          for one person (weekly calls with a parent, for instance) may be
          completely wrong for another.
        </p>

        <h3><em>4. Spiritual Self-Care</em></h3>
        <p>
          Not everyone has a spiritual or religious need. However, for many
          caregivers, whether they are social workers, nurses or other
          clinicians, a spiritual practice can provide comfort and strength.
          Paying attention to and tending to one’s spiritual needs, such as
          through regular prayer, meditation or meetings with a spiritual
          adviser, is often part of an effective self-care plan.
        </p>

        <h3><em>5. Professional and Educational Self-Care</em></h3>
        <p>
          School and work responsibilities can be overwhelming at times. Trying
          to manage all of these obligations can be a source of much stress,
          even in a fulfilling job or degree program. Taking the time to learn
          best practices such as setting goals, using time management techniques
          and setting boundaries with coworkers can help an individual get a
          handle on these pressures.
