        <h2 id="title1"><em>WHAT IS SPIRITUAL HEALTH?</em></h2>
        <p>
          I feel like nailing your spiritual self care practice requires first
          having an understanding on what spiritual self care actually is.<br />
          While physical self care is directed at taking care of the body and
          mental self care is directed at taking care of the mind, spiritual
          self care is focused on taking
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >care of the soul.</a
          >
          <br />
          This means that in simple terms spiritual self care activities are
          ones with the aim of caring for and replenishing our soul self to make
          sure this part of us is healthy and well. <br />
          Spiritual self care activities can also be understood as activities
          that help you find fulfilment on a level that extends beyond the self
          (or ego) by connecting to the Universe <br />or another higher power
          that you believe in. <br />
          I'll tell you about some spiritual self care ideas for a Healthy Soul
          bellow.

      <section>
        <h2 title2 id="title2"><em>1. PRACTICE MEDITATION</em></h2>
        <p>
          Before we pretend to be surprised, we all knew meditation was going to
          be on this list. But I promise I’m not saying it to be generic,<br />
          meditation genuinely is one of the most important practices for taking
          care of the soul. Meditation allows us to slow down the cognitive mind
          and access our more intuitive self, <br />
          which in turn allows us to tune into our soul’s wants and needs. And a
          solid meditation practice also raises our vibration and helps us to
          live more in alignment with our <br />
          soul self. Many people immediately discount meditation because they
          misunderstand it – but meditation doesn’t have to be about completely
          quietening the mind. <br />
          It can simply be bringing more mindfulness and attention to the
          present moment. In fact, there are tons of different meditation styles
          that exist and it’s worth <br />
          exploring a different style if one of them doesn’t suit you.

      <section>
        <h2 id="title3"><em>2. PRACTICE YOGA OR TAI CHI</em></h2>
        <p>
          Yoga is another firm favorite of mine for taking care of the soul. If
          you’ve read about my story then you’ll know that yoga was actually
          <br />
          the catalyst for my spiritual journey, and I fell in love with it so
          much that I went on to complete my yoga teacher training after a
          couple of years of dedicated practice. So trust me <br />
          when I say that yoga isn’t just about fancy IG photos and poses that
          look hella uncomfortable, it’s a journey into the soul which
          incorporates mindful movement with other <br />
          tools such as pranayama (breathwork) to go within. And if you need
          help getting started, these
          <a
            href="https://www.throughthephases.com/best-30-day-yoga-challenge/"
            target="_blank"
            >30 day yoga challenges</a
          >
          are amazing for exploring the practice and <br />
          helping you stay committed! But if yoga isn’t your vibe, that’s okay
          too. Because Tai Chi is another mindful movement based practice that’s
          also amazing for <br />
          spiritual self care. Tai Chi is a gentle form of martial arts that is
          about balancing yin and yang energy in the body and creating harmony
          on a mind, body <br />
          & soul level. So if this is something that interests you then see if
          there are any local classes in the area to explore the benefits of
          this practice for yourself!

        <h2 id="title4"><em>3. SPEND TIME IN NATURE</em></h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever spent time in nature and just noticed how much more at
          peace you feel? That’s because nature is a high vibrational <br />
          environment that quite literally nourishes our soul and recharges us
          on an energetic level. And it can also be a potent reminder of the
          synchronicities of the Universe and of life <br />
          beyond our own experience. ​We are meant to be amongst nature after
          all! Before the rise of industrialisation we were much more “at one”
          with nature, and now we’re <br />
          feeling the difference of being so far disconnected from our roots.
          The truth is, we could all benefit from spending more time in nature,
          and getting outside <br />
          at least once a day should be something that you aim for to keep your
          soul healthy and energised! So whether it’s going for a mindful walk,
          doing <br />
          a spot of gardening, or sitting by a lake, try to prioritise a form of
          nature that fills up your cup.
